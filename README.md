How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By using White Box Review Testing Tecnhniques before coding, using Black Box Testing techniques and tools such as J-Unit during/after coding, and experience based testing techniques as the project and my coding skills continue to evolve.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
First the functional and non-functional requirements of the design to be implimented need to be efficiently mapped out by understanding the users needs, documenting them, and organizing them so that you know what will need to be incorporated into the code.
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software from a user needs perspective first. I then focus on effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency.
